<h1>Digital Chronicles</h1>
<p>By: Naomi Carrillo
<em>What is <strong>digital</strong> to me?</em></p>
<p>When we think about “digital,” we might often think about our phones and social media handles and what might be trending. It isn’t so far off; however, when I think about “digital,” my first thought leads to my camera, the pictures I’ve taken that only I have “created,” and the storytelling through imagery that I will convey to an audience, and to that, these are my “Digital Chronicles.”</p>
<p>As Destin Sparks once said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“Photography is the story I fail to put into words.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I must agree with this at a personal level.</p>

<p>Publishing this moment that day allowed me to share a moment of an unusual weather occurrence. It became a part of my life for quite some while; the way that I published my creative work was on Instagram. It allowed me to share information about the weather and put my creative insights to use. I was connecting with an audience who enjoyed photography and landscapes just as I did. However, in the future, I would be OK with publishing on websites such as Medium or WordPress. This is because I prefer digital platforms to publish my works to reach a wider audience. However, thanks to the search engine and keywords, my work might also be shown through other algorithms across the web and media.</p>

<p>Publishing, in this case, and perhaps in general, would mean not being able to receive feedback and contribute to the so-called audience in a more in-depth conversation. However, publishing through Instagram also welcomes the opportunity to use other digital handles or forms of online platforms such as blogs. Regarding my photographs, I have already done different photoshoots for people, animals, and landscapes. I suggest publishing or sharing the rights to the photographs with a copyright license suitable for other digital content such as articles, presentations, and other users and collaborations.</p>

<strong>Just a fun close-up of that picture, April 19th, 2019</strong></p>
<p>I enjoy taking photos of anything beautiful to the eye at that moment.
Primarily photos of color; there is a saying by Celerie Kemble that says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“There is a reason we don't see the world in black and white.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Publishing can be utilized in many ways.</p>
<ol>
<li>We break barriers and reach a more global audience by spreading content to others.</li>
<li>We create forms for others that become more accessible, such as hyperlinks, multimedia, and content that engages users in reading experiences.</li>
<li>Search engines allow our writing to be more information-specific and quicker; it is efficient, especially regarding cost.</li>
<li>Digital publishing is much more cost-efficient than traditional print methods and distribution to a broader audience.</li>
</ol>
<p>This pro in this area motivates me further to publish my work digitally. It is crucial for today to be interconnected with the outside world; it's accessible and efficient in receiving news and whatnot. It motivates me to contribute to a broad audience in the area I focus on posting. We share knowledge and understanding, and this is important. Digital publishing provides opportunities to experiment with the expression that engages and allows us to explore innovative forms of storytelling, all while communicating to even a global audience.</p>
